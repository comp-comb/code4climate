Today we will use real monitoring data to calculate AQI for a time and place (in Wisconsin) of your chosing.\n","\n","1. [Download data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OYCup15Mtp-Mi0vn0nWgjpcBd0wN6zIx#scrollTo=riKJ6xB4O9da) for a day for a location in Wisconsin from the Department of Natural Resources website.\n","2. We have provided you a `prepare_dnr_data_station_report()` function like we did for the earlier project to clean the data for your calculation.\n","  - The input into this function will just be the filename\n","3. Use `numpy` module to extract the appropriate data from this DataFrame to calculate AQI **based on PM2.5 concentration**.\n","4. Write a function that calculates AQI using the formula [given below](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OYCup15Mtp-Mi0vn0nWgjpcBd0wN6zIx#scrollTo=V3jpCP_uDZcr)\n","  - The function must take in a single value of the measured concetration ($C$) as input and return the calculated AQI\n","5. Plot the AQI (using PM2.5 as pollutant) vs time using Matplotlib\n","\n","### Extra Practice\n","- Calculate and plot AQI using Ozone as pollutant\n","- Plot how the temperature and relative humidity varied hourly through the day\n","- Report the maximum and minimum temperature of the day.\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YyWHdn_sO5eG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","## Calculating AQI\n","Air Quality Index is calculated separately for each pollutant based on the concentration of that specific pollutant.
