# WELCOME!
This is archive of final curriculum of **Code for Climate 2025**

## What is Code for Climate?
It is a summer school for high school students interested in learning Python. Below is the text used in promoting the program

```
Are you interested in learning to code? Curious about the air quality and air pollution in your community? Wondering how forecasters predict weather? Or want to learn how to interpret and explain climate change data? In this program, participants will learn coding while investigating real-world climate and air pollution data.

This program offers hands-on experience with programming fundamentals, and participants will write their own code to analyze data using Python. They will also learn how to monitor air quality and explore how air quality affects communities.

By the end of the experience, students will have written a program to explore, analyze and visualize Milwaukee air quality data.

No prior coding experience is necessary. This program is a good fit for any high schooler interested in engineering, especially those interested in learning to code. Coding is a skill that is useful in almost every discipline of science and engineering. 

Note: experience in algebra is required.

This was organized at Marquette University, Milwaukee from 28 July - 01 August 2025
